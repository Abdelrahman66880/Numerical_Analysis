Numerical analysis is a branch of mathematics that focuses on developing and implementing algorithms to obtain approximate solutions to complex mathematical problems. It plays a crucial role in scientific computing, enabling the practical application of mathematical models in various fields such as engineering, physics, finance, and data science. Key methods in numerical analysis include interpolation, integration, differentiation, root-finding, and solving systems of linear and nonlinear equations. These methods are essential for tasks such as optimizing functions, simulating physical systems, and analyzing large datasets, where exact solutions are often unattainable or computationally infeasible.
